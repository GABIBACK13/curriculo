      The company requested the development of a landing page to promote its cake
      customization services, aiming to enhance visibility and attract new customers. 
      My responsibility was to create a dynamic and responsive page that provided an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. 
      To achieve this, I developed the page statically using JavaScript for interactivity and CSS Flexbox 
      for a flexible and responsive layout. As a result, the project increased the company's promotional reach,
      attracting new customers and expanding its market potential. Dev Skills:
        - Responsive Design
        - UI/UX design
        - JavaScript

      I developed from scratch a spreadsheet for inventory management that automatically notified when items were below the expected quantity.
      This solution increased efficiency in demand ordering and significantly reduced errors. 
      Additionally, I was responsible for troubleshooting simple and recurring technical issues, 
      ensuring that employees had continuous access to essential technological resources. 
      I also reorganized computer labs and maintained peripherals to improve functionality and user experience. 
      Beyond technical responsibilities, I supervised students during breaks, organizing them in recreational areas to ensure their safety. 
      I also assisted in classrooms by delivering educational content and, during the last recess, 
      was responsible for closing the institution and directing students to their respective transportation.
